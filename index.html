         <p>
        Hello! I'm Divyam Gupta, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, Boston, currently seeking AI/ML internship opportunities for Summer 2026/Fall 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
       I am a passionate applied researcher dedicated to advancing the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision. My work primarily focused on domain generalization, domain adaptation, and generalized category discovery. Broadly, I have studied vision‚Äìlanguage models (VLMs), foundation models, multimodal learning, and the knowledge embedded within these models: what they learn about the real world during training, how this knowledge is stored in their parameters, how it is represented and retrieved, and how it can be effectively leveraged to enhance performance on downstream tasks.
       I am open to exploring new research directions and collaborations in these exciting areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting my Masters, I was an Assistant Researcher at MBZUAI, Abu Dhabi working under <a href="https://m-haris-khan.com/" class="link-red">Dr.Muhammad Haris Khan</a> on tackling Image classification in domain generalized settings using label graphs . I also completed my B.Tech from <a href="#" class="link">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> this year, where I majored in Chemical Engineering with received a minors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I carried out AI and vision research under the guidance of <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io" class="link-red">Dr.Biplab Banerjee</a>  leading to publications at top-tier AI conferences where I primarily worked on Multimodal learning and Vision language models.  I received the Undergraduate research award for one of my research work on image retrieval work which got accepted at ECCV 2024. 
        </p>

          Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to connect regarding research collaborations, internships, or just to say hi!
